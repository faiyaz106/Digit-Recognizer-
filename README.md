### Digit-Recognizer by using Deep Learning

#### Problem statement: To correctly identify the hand written digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

#### About the data
Data Link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data
The data files train.csv and test.csv contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.
Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.

#### About the Model Building:
In this I have trained Deep Learning Models based on Artificial Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network. and Compared the performance of system.
On Test set: CNN accuracy: 98% and ANN accuracy: 97% . Both type of models doing pretty well for identifying the handwritten digits.
##### For Fun: I built the GUI based on python script.
